# chinese_money_lending_analysis
This project analyzes the lending pattern of Chinese banks.
- The dataset was taken from Kaggle.
- EDA was performed and Data engineering was done to make new columns from the existing ones.
- The data was then analyzed using visualizations and inferences were drawn.
- The data was cleaned so ML models could be trained to predict the amount of loans Chinese banks would give out in a particular case.
